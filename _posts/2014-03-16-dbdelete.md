This command can be used, to reduce database size by deleting records according
to a condition. For instance, removing wp_posts revisions.


#### Config file

The config for this command goes under `cleanup.delete` section. It is an array
of operations. Each operation is related to a table. the fields are the following :

* table : table name
* multi : For wordpress multi-instance. (see. db:truncate)
* conditions : An array of AND conditions. Each condition is :
 * field : string representing a table column
 * operator : SQL operator (<, >, <>, etc ...)
 * value : value on which the field will be compared against

Behind the scences, conditions will be passed to [Laravel / Query builder]((http://laravel.com/docs/queries#selects)) `where` clause.

```php
<?php
foreach ($tableOperations->conditions as $cond) {
    $dbTable->where($cond->field, $cond->operator, $cond->value);
}
```
